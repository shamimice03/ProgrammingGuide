This project is based on e-learning and e-exam system for programming learners. There are many functions on this project such as user management, course enrollment, topics selection, online test, global scoreboard, online book library, forum system and so on.

Problem-solving skill is one of the most important skills mainly for computer science students. In this` system user can learn programming and as well as gets guidelines for solving related problems from several online judges.
